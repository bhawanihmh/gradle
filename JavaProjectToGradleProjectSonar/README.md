# Convert Plan Java Project To Gradle Java Project #

## Steps to build ##
* __ Copy build.gradle and settings.gradle at roon directory
* __ Run command : "gradle wrapper" : to generate wrapper files for gradle project
* __ Run command : "gradlew build OR gradle build" : to build gradle project
* __ Run command : "gradle task fatJar" : to generate jar file for project

## Content of setting.gradle file ##
rootProject.name = 'javaProjectToGradleProject'

## Content of build.gradle file with some details ##
```

Customizing file and directory locations
Imagine you have a legacy project that uses an src directory for the production 
code and test for the test code. The conventional directory structure won’t work, 
so you need to tell Gradle where to find the source files. You do that via source set configuration.

Each source set defines where its source code resides, along with the resources 
and the output directory for the class files.
sourceSets {
    main {
         java {
            srcDirs = ['src']
         }
    }

    test {
        java {
            srcDirs = ['test']
        }
    }
}
Now Gradle will only search directly in src and test for the respective source code. 
What if you don’t want to override the convention, but simply want to add an extra source 
directory, perhaps one that contains some third-party source code you want to keep separate? 
sourceSets {
    main {
        java {
            srcDir 'thirdParty/src/main/java'
        }
    }
}
*/
sourceSets {
    main {
         java {
            srcDirs = ['src']
         }
    }

    test {
        java {
            srcDirs = ['test']
        }
    }
}

sourceCompatibility
Defines which language version of Java your source files should be treated as.

targetCompatibility
Defines the minimum JVM version your code should run on, i.e. it determines the 
version of byte code the compiler generates.
